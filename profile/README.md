# Dear Teams, welcome to the IEEE-HKN International Hackathon repository!

We are pleased to have reached your interest in participating in this new edition of the International Hackathon created by IEEE-HKN with official starting date on 14 November 2025.
In this platform, each of you will be able to collaborate with your team, while also challenging yourself in solving the task provided during this hackathon.

Until the challenge opens, we suggest that each of you gets familiar with the platform and look at these [documents](https://github.com/HKN-HACKATHON/docs/tree/main/guides) that will guide you on how to use the tools useful for submitting your work on this platform.
